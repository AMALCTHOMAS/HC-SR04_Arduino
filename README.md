# HC-SR04 Distance Sensor Integration with Arduino

## Introduction

This documentation provides instructions for integrating the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor with an Arduino board to measure distances and display the results on the Serial Monitor. The HC-SR04 sensor utilizes ultrasonic waves to determine the distance to an object, making it suitable for applications requiring distance sensing.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

## HC-SR04 Sensor Features

- Working Voltage: 5V
- Number of Pins: 4 (VCC, GND, Trig, Echo)

## Libraries Used

The HC-SR04 library used for this project was developed by Dhruba Saha and can be installed from the Arduino Library Manager.
